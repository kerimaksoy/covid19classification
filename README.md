<h2 align="center">Dataset</h2>
<h4 align="left">The dataset used in this project includes data collected from different people in the May 2020 bundle. The data set consists of 21 features and 5434 samples.</h4>

<h2 align="center">Results</h2>
<h4 align="left">Experiments were carried out according to the 10-fold cross-validation test technique. With the 10-fold cross-validation test technique, the data are randomly divided into 10 subsets, with the plus and minus classes being equal within themselves. Nine sets are used for training and one set for testing. This process is repeated 10 times by shifting. Performance metrics are recalculated with each swipe. Thus, 10 performance metrics are obtained. When the test process is finished, the average of these values is taken. The average values of 6 different classification algorithms with 7 different performance metrics are given in the table below.
